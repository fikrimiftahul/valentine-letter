I made this code to express my love for my lover, with a simple construction using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

# How to run this code:
1. If you want it simple, just give the index.html file to the people you love.
2. If you want to be more special, you can use cheap hosting to make it look more professional.

**Note:** You can change the words and images you want in the <img> section for images and <p> for sentences.
